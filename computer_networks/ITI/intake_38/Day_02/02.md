## TCP/IP Model

### Objectives
- TCP/IP Protocol Suite
- Application Layer
- Transport Layer
  - TCP
  - UDP
- Network Layer

### Why TCP/IP ?
- Standard
- Routable 
- Cross Platform
- Dominant commercial protocol architecture
- Specified and extensively used before OSI
- Developed by research funded US - Department of Defense
- Used by the Internet

### TCP/IP Protocol Architecture
- Application Layer
  - Communication between processes or applications
- Transport Layer (TCP/UDP)
  - End to end transfer of data
  - May include reliability mechanism (TCP)
  - Hides detail of underlying network
- Internet Layer (IP)
  - Routing of data
- Network Layer
  - Logical interface between end system and network
- Physical Layer
  - Transmission medium
  - Signal rate and encoding

### TCP/IP Acronyms
- Protocol Data Unit (PDU)
- Encapsulation
- Decapsulation
- Segmentation

### UDP
- User Datagram Protocol
- Transport layer protocol
- Process to process communication
  - Use port numbers
- Connectionless 
- Unreliable
- Perform very limited error checking
- Very simple using a minimum of overhead

### TCP
- Transmission Control Protocol
- Transport layer protocol
- Process to process communication 
- Use port numbers
- Reliable ( Use acknowledgements )
- Connection oriented (Three way handshake)
- Flow control (window size)

### Port Numbers
- Well Known ports
- Range from 0 to 1,023 
- Registered ports
  - Range from 1,024 to 49,151 not assigned or controlled by ICANN but can be registered at ICANN to avoid duplication
- Dynamic ports
  - Range from 49,152 to 65,535 are neither controlled nor registered
