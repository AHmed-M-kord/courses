## OSI Model

### Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Differentiate between the seven layers in OSI model
- Define the importance of OSI model
Name and order the seven layers in OSI model
- Illustrate how the data find its way through the network from the sender to the receiver

### OSI Reference Model
- OSI: Open Systems Interconnection
- The OSI model is the primary architectural model for networks. 
- It describes how data and network information are communicated from an application on one computer, through the network media, to an application on another computer.
- The model was defined by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
- The OSI reference model breaks this approach into layers.

### Advantages of Reference Models
- It divides the network communication process into smaller and simpler components, thus aiding component development, design, and troubleshooting.
- It allows multiple-vendor development through standardization of network components.
- It encourages industry standardization by defining what functions occur at each layer of the model.
- It allows various types of network hardware and software to communicate.
- It prevents changes in one layer from affecting other layers, so it does not hamper development.

### OSI Seven Layers
- Application 
- Presentation 
- Session 
- Transport
- Network 
- Data Link
- Physical

### Application Layer
- Provides a mean for the user to access information on the network through an application
- This layer is the main interface for the user(s) to interact with the application and therefore the network
- Displays received information and sends data to lower layers.
- What should I send?
  - End-user Interface
  - Where client applications reside
  - Displays received information
  - Sends user’s data to lower layers

### Presentation Layer
- The presentation layer is responsible for the delivery and formatting of information to the application layer for further processing or display. 
- It relieves the application layer of concern regarding syntactical differences in data representation within the end-user systems. 
- An example of a presentation service would be the conversion of an EBCDIC-coded text file to an ASCII-coded file. 

### Session Layer
-  Controls the sessions between the local and    remote applications

### Transport Layer
- Till now, there is Session opening between the Sender and the Receiver
- But if the receiver is Opening more than one application, How the Sender direct the data to the right application? 
- There is services that can be optionally provided at this layer:
  - Connection-Oriented  
  - Reliable Data

### Transport Layer Services
- Organize data into segments
- Provide transparent transfer of data between hosts
- It is usually responsible for end-to-end error recovery and flow control, and ensuring complete data transfer
- Port #

### Network Layer
- Data in Network Layer is converted into a Packet, which is: Segment + Header
- Network Layer has a Logical Address (IP Address)
- Header carries Source IP Address, and Destination IP Address
- Routing
  - Provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable length data sequences from a source to a destination via one or more networks 

### Data Link Layer
- Responsible for organizing data into Frames, by adding Header.
- Header holds Source Mac Address and Destination Mac Address
- Trailer holds the result of CRC: Cyclic Redundancy Check
- Reliable data transfer across a physical link
- It provides the means to detect errors that may occur in the Physical layer

### MAC Address
- Media Access Control Address
- Unique Identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications on the physical network
- Managed by Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
- 48 bits:
  - 24 bits for the Vendor
  - 24 bits for the Serial No.

### Switches and MAC Addresses
- Switches has MAC Address Table
- Empty MAC Address Table at the beginning

### Switch MAC Learning Process

### Physical Layer
- The Physical layer defines all the electrical and physical specifications for devices. 
- The physical layer is the most basic network layer, providing only the means of transmitting raw bits.
- No Protocols
