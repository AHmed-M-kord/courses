## Network Transmission Media

### Network Transmission Media
- To transmit data, a medium must exist
- The medium can be in the form of cables or wireless medium
- Most common used media for data networks
  - Cable media
  - Wireless media

- Cable Media 
  - Twisted Pair Cables
    - STP
    - UTP
  - Fiber Optic Cables
  - Coaxial Cables

- Wireless Media
  - Infra red 
  - Microwave
  - Bluetooth

### Cable Media
- There are several types of cable which are commonly used with LANs. 
- In some cases, a network will utilize only one type of cable, other networks will use a variety of cable types. 
- The type of cable chosen for a network is related to the network's topology, protocol, and size. 

### Twisted pair cable
- Most widely used (Ethernet networks)
- The segment can’t exceed 100 meters
- Two basic types
  - STP
  - UTP
- Use RJ-45 connectors
- Crimper tool attach the twisted pair cable to RJ-45

### Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)
- Low Cost
- Easy Installation
- Bandwidth ~ 1,4,10,16,100,1000 Mbps
- Attenuation ~ hundred of meters (high)

- Bandwidth (data transfer rate) the amount of data that can be carried from one point to another in a given time period, usually a second

- Attenuation, is a loss of signal strength measured in decibles. Occurs for different reasons:
range, both wireless and wired transmissions gradually dissipate in strength over longer reaches
- Interference, on wireless networks, radio interference or physical obstructions like walls dampen communication signals
- Wire size – on wired networks, thinner wires suffer from hiegher (more) attenuation than thicker wires

- Attenuation is the opposite of amplification

### UTP Categories
- The UTP cables are classified into many types  called categories:
  - Cat 1 : which supports up to 1 Mbps
  - Cat 2 : which supports up to 4 Mbps
  - Cat 3 : which supports up to 10 Mbps
  - Cat 4 : which supports up to 16 Mbps
  - Cat 5 : which supports up to 100 Mbps ( this is the kind used in Ethernet networks )

- The principle upon which the UTP cables are classified is the amount of twisting,  when the twisting amount is increased, the interference amount is decreased, . as a final result, the bandwidth the cable support increases

### UTP Categories
<img alt="UTP Categories" src="https://github.com/helghareeb/courses/blob/master/computer_networks/ITI/intake_38/Day_01/img/045.jpg" />

<img alt="UTP Categories" src="https://github.com/helghareeb/courses/blob/master/computer_networks/ITI/intake_38/Day_01/img/046.jpg" />

- (a) Category 3 UTP
- (b) Category 5 UTP

### Shielded Twisted Pair (STP)
- Moderate Cost
- Fairly Easy Installation
- Bandwidth ~ more than same cat of UTP
- Attenuation ~ hundred of meters

### Twisted Pair Cable Connection Types
- Dropped Cable (Patch Chord / Straight)
- Cross-over Cable 
- Rolled-over Cable

### Dropped (Patch Chord / Straight) Cable

### Rolled-over Cable

### Coaxial
- Cost is Moderate
- Fairly Easy Installation
- Bandwidth ~ 10 Mbps
- Attenuation ~ few hundreds of meters

### Fiber-Optic
- Highest Cost
- Difficult Installation
- Bandwidth ~ 2 Gbps
- Attenuation ~ ten of kilometers (low)

### Wireless Media
- Flexible (Used in areas where it is hard to install cables ) 
- Used in wireless LANs
- Hybrid environment is one which wireless components communicate with a network that use cables
