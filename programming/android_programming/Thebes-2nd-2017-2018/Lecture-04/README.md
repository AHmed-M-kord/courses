## Lecture Objectives
- Show all the steps and code necessary to build a mobile application
- Step-by-Step
- Based on the tutorial https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/build-your-first-android-app-kotlin/index.html

## Lecture Contents: What we will learn
- How to use Android Studio to build your app.
- How to run your app on a device or in the emulator.
- How to add interactive buttons.
- How to display a second screen.

## What you must know already

- This codelab is written for programmers and assumes you know either Java or Kotlin. 
- If you are an experienced programmer and you are adept at reading code, you will likely be able to follow this codelab even if you don't have much experience with Kotlin.

### Step Zero
- Install Android Studio (with Kotlin support)

### Step One: Create First Project
- Main Activity
- Make an empty project (remember to include Kotlin support - Resize the window if needed)
- Deployment (on emulator and read device)

### Step Two: Explore the Layout editor
- Each screen in Android app is associated with one Java or Kotlin class known as an activity
- The single screen with "Hello World" displayed is created by one activity, called MainActivity.kt
- This was generated when we created the new project
- Each visible activity in an Android app has a layout that defines the user interface for the activity
- Android Studio has a layout editor where we can create and define layouts
- Layouts are defined in XML
- Layout editor lets us define and modify layout either by coding XML or by using the interactive visual editor
- We can switch between editing layout in XML and in the visual design editor
- Every element in a layout is a view

- In this task, we will explore some of the panels in the layout editor, and we will learn how to change property values for views

### Step Three: Add String and Color Resources
- Using resources enables you to use the same values in multiple places, or to define values and have the UI update automatically whenever the value is changed.
- What we will learn
  - How to extract property values into resources.
  - How resources are defined.
  - Adding and using color resources.
  - The results of changing layout height and width.

### Step Four: Add Views and Constraints
- How to add new views to your layout.
- How to constrain the position of a view to another view.

### Step Five: Make the App Interactive
- Currently the buttons do nothing
- In this task, we will make the buttons respond when the user presses them
- First we will make the Toast button show a pop-up message called a toast
- Next we will make the Count button update the number that is displayed in the TextView

- What you'll learn
  - How to add onClick methods for a view.
  - How to find a view by its ID.
  - How to set and get property values of a view.
