# Make two new lists from this list.
#   The first new list should contain
#   the first half of data, in the same
#   order, whilst the second list should
#   contain the second half, so:
#	data = first_half + second_half
#   If there are an odd number of items,
#   make the first new list the larger
#   list.



# Print the new lists.
