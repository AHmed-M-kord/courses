### Agile 101
- integration: integrate early and often
- deployment: deploy as the final stage of CI
- continous delivery: software is always deployable

### Continous Integration
Fast, automated feedback on the correctness of your application everytime there is a change to code

### Continous Delivery
Fast, automated feedback on the production readiness of your application everytime thre is a change - to code, infrastructure, or configuration

- test scripts
- automated test cases
- network config scripts
- technical documentation
- database creation, manipulation, and initialization scripts
- application scripts

### Architecting for Change
- Our business is continously changing to meet new demands of the market place
- we need faster time to market to remain competitive
- Our plan is to engage heavily in mergers and acquisitions
- architecture agility: the ability to respond quickly to a constantly changing environment
