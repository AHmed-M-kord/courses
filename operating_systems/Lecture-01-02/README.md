## Operating Systems
- source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system" > https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system </a>
- An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. All computer programs, excluding firmware, require an operating system to function.

- Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, printing, and other resources.

## Examples of operating systems
- Unix and Unix-like operating systems
  - BSD and its descendants
    - macOS
    - Linux
- Microsoft Windows
- Other

## Kernel
- With the aid of the firmware and device drivers, the kernel provides the most basic level of control over all of the computer's hardware devices. 
- It manages memory access for programs in the RAM, it determines which programs get access to which hardware resources, it sets up or resets the CPU's operating states for optimal operation at all times, and it organizes the data for long-term non-volatile storage with file systems on such media as disks, tapes, flash memory, etc.

## Linux Kernel
The Linux kernel is a monolithic Unix-like computer operating system kernel. The Linux family of operating systems is based on this kernel and deployed on both traditional computer systems such as personal computers and servers, usually in the form of Linux distributions,[9] and on various embedded devices such as routers, wireless access points, PBXes, set-top boxes, FTA receivers, smart TVs, PVRs, and NAS appliances. The Android operating system for tablet computers, smartphones, and smartwatches uses services provided by the Linux kernel to enable its functionality. While the adoption on desktop computers is low, Linux-based operating systems dominate nearly every other segment of computing, from mobile devices to mainframes. As of November 2017, all of the world's 500 most powerful supercomputers run Linux.[10]
